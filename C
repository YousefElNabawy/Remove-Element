Explanation of the Code
int k = 0 ;: This index tells us where to place the next element that isn't equal to val.
Loop through nums:
  For each nums[i], if it isn't equal to val, we place it at nums[write_index] and increment write_index.
  This effectively removes elements equal to val from the array by skipping over them.
Return k: The value of write_index at the end of the loop represents the number of elements in nums that are not equal to val


int removeElement(int* nums, int numsSize, int val) {
    int k = 0;  // This will track the number of elements not equal to val
    
    // Iterate over each element in nums
    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        // If the current element is not equal to val, keep it in the array
        if (nums[i] != val) {
            nums[k] = nums[i];
            k++;
        }
    }
    
    // Return the count of elements not equal to val
    return k;
}
